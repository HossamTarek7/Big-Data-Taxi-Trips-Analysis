# Big Data Taxi Trips Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves in-depth analysis and exploration of taxi trips data using big data tools and techniques. The analysis is divided into three main parts: data cleaning, data visualization, and machine learning.

## Notebooks

### Data Cleaning Notebook
The data cleaning notebook (`Big Data Proj Taxi-Trips Data Cleaning.ipynb`) covers various operations to prepare the taxi trips data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and restructuring data for further analysis.

### Data Visualization Notebook
The data visualization notebook (`Big Data Proj Taxi-Trips Data Visulaization.ipynb`) focuses on visualizing key insights from the taxi trips data. This includes analyzing taxi demand patterns by hour/day, exploring correlation between trip features, and identifying trends in fare/tip amounts.

### Machine Learning Notebook
The machine learning notebook (`Big Data Proj Taxi-Trips Machine Learning.ipynb`) delves into predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms. It includes splitting the data into training/testing sets, training regression models, and evaluating their performance in predicting fare amounts.

## Dependencies
The notebooks use several Python libraries and packages, including Snowflake for data processing, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and pandas for data manipulation.

## Results and Insights
Through this analysis, we gain insights into various aspects of taxi trips data, such as:
- Patterns in taxi demand based on time of day/week
- Correlation between trip features like distance and fare amount
- Predictive modeling of fare amounts using regression techniques

The project aims to showcase the power of big data analytics in understanding and deriving meaningful insights from large-scale transportation data.
